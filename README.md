Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

HeartDiseaseML is a supervised machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence based on clinical and patient health data.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how classification models can support early detection of cardiovascular conditions and assist in preventive healthcare decision-making.

🎯 Business / Clinical Problem

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality globally. Early prediction of heart disease risk enables:

Preventive medical intervention

Improved patient monitoring

Better allocation of healthcare resources

Reduced long-term treatment costs

This project builds a predictive model that classifies whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

🛠 Tech Stack
